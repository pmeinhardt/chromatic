chromatic.sh
===

Update your Chromium installation with a convenient command line script: `chromatic.sh`. To get started simply `sudo make install`.

The script will fetch the latest Chromium build from [here](http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?path=Mac/) and install it in your `/Applications` directory, moving your previously installed version to the Trash.
